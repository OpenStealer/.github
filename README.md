# OpenStealer

## What Will This Repo Contain ?

`I will put there a example of stealer that could be good enough to not need to buy any other one but would still need to be updated to add/update features :)`

## Why ?

`Well since I see a lot of stealers selling high priced services I want to help people that can't pay and avoid grabbers that will make you feel good and don't need t stress about your webhook or anything ! :)`

## Any Planned Release Date ?

`Nope, be patient.`
