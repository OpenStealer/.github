# OpenStealer

## What Will This Repo Contain ?

`I will put there a example of stealer that could be good enough to not need to buy any other one but would still need to be updated to add/update features :)`

## Why ?

`Well since I see a lot of stealers selling high priced services I want to help people that can't pay and avoid grabbers that will make you feel good and don't need t stress about your webhook or anything ! :)`

## Any Planned Release Date ?

`Nope, be patient.`

## FAQ

    </summary>
    
- Why will this project take time before being released ?
  - Actually already have some things to finish
  - Not sure when I will be able to use my computer again because I'm moving
  - I want to offer something good enough to avoid paying for shitty pasted stealers but not good enough to be sold everywhere
  - I have to think on a update frequency since probably no one will contribute to it

- Will the duplicates be automatically removed ?
  - Yes.
  
- What will be the MAIN Stub language ?
  - JS if prices goes lower and C++ if prices goes higher (for other stealers). [Future potential languages for stubs](https://github.com/OpenStealer#polls)

- Will any custom obfuscator/crypter be "included" ?
  - Well it's not sure but it could be done after some update, here is a poll for [Stub Obfuscator/Crypter](https://github.com/OpenStealer#polls)

- Will it have multiple stubs(multiple languages)
  - I will think about it.
  
- Will I be able to share my panel access to my friends ?
  - No, it will be blocked to 1 user on the account, but you will be able to modify this in the code yourself.
  
- Will it use its own storage server and why ?
  - Probably I will have to think about it, because anonfiles etc.. delete your files so you could use a second server made for storage or your actual one. Tell me if it should use its own [storage system](https://github.com/OpenStealer#polls) or a external one.

- Will it support multiple-domains ?
  - It could be done for a private version or something like this if a domain get seized/down.
 
- Can I report a bug/problem ?
  - Yes, you can [Open a Bug Report Issue](https://github.com/OpenStealer/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)

- Can I suggest a feature/update ?
  - Yes, you can [Open a Feature Request Issue](https://github.com/OpenStealer/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+Request&template=feature_request.md&title=)

- Can I ask a question ?
  - Yes, you can [Open a Question Issue](https://github.com/OpenStealer/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Question&template=Question.md&title=)
  
- Will a demo version be hosted ?
  - I think it could be done, but the server would be paid with donations only and you would have to spread the stub yourself, the settings would not be editable to avoid anyone to receive the logs they would only show on the panel. If you want to donate for a demo server you can contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/HideakiAtsuyo)
